This was an interactive presentation given at a joint meeting of NoCo JavaScript and GDG Northern Colorado on July 13, 2015.

To just view the slides, download talk.html and open in any modern browser.

To view the slides and use the dev environment just start a web server in the build directory.

I include a copy of the built for convenience, but if you want to change things, do:

```
bower install
npm install
gulp // Will build then start a webserver with live-reload.
```
