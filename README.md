This was an interactive presentation given at a joint meeting of NoCo JavaScript and GDG Northern Colorado on July 13, 2015.

For the moment only the slides (made using remark: [https://github.com/gnab/remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)) are available. The version of remark is slightly modified so that it supports modern version of IE (only IE 11 has been tested)... I will be making those changes available soon, along with rest of the tiny development environment we used.

To view the slides, download talk.html and open in any modern browser.
