You will need to visit each site to see their licensing (all open source):

Remark (for the slide show). https://github.com/gnab/remark
I made a few changes for IE support, and have made a pull request for them, see: 
https://github.com/briansturgill/remark

TypeScript, this was a clone of their development branch, necessary because I was demoing
with async/await support which is not released yet. https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript

Ace Editor: https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/
Ace Editor is hard to build from scratch, so I modified (very slightly) a minified file, see the
ace-editor directory.

And of course all of the things in the node_modules and bower_components directories.
